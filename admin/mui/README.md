# Yummy Meals Order List with React

This Frontend fetches its meal order data from the Backend RESTful microservice: [Yummy Meals Order Microservice](https://github.com/developertogo/yummy-meals-microservice"). 

Its implementation was based on the [Refine Admin Material UI FineFoods](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/next/examples/finefoods-mui) sample code.

The UI view displays:

* The orders for a user
* Each order should show:
  * the delivery date
  * the meal names
  * the meal images
  * the quantity of each meal

#### Users List


#### User Orders List


#### User Order Details
